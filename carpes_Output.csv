Upside! The University Hotel in Berkeley, California offers an investor the opportunity to dramatically increase the annual net operating income and cash flow from their current levels.The University Hotel is situated on one of Berkeley' s highest traffic arterials, University Avenue, and is just two blocks away from the University of California campus. The subject property is mixed-use, and is comprised of 50 SRO residential units over two ground floor retail suites. Upside in the income stream is realized through more efficient management of the residential units which are significantly under rented. Of the 50 units, 92% have yet to be  raised to today' s market level of $700 per month. The ground floor retail is similarly underachieving with current rents far below that of today' s market level, of $2.00 per square foot triple-net for similar retail space in this trade area.
The residential portion of the building is a typical SRO-unit configuration with common area only restrooms, and showers/vanity/tub amenities. The two ground level retail suites flank the entry lobby and are industry standard for this trade area as to depths. Built in 1919, the University Hotel is of woodframe construction with masonry exterior walls and is approximately 16,840 gross square feet in size over three floors. The parcel size is approximately 6,651 square feet and enjoys the rare Hotel (89) zoning. Only 5 other properties in the city of Berkeley over 20 units (source: Realquest, Inc.) enjoy this unique zoning making the University Hotel one of a select group of assets which can cater to this specific high-demand residential rental pool.
